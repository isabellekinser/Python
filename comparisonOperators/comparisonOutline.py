This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = apples
b = bananas
h = (a == b)
print(h)


#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 12
b = 12
h = (a == b)
print(h)


#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 20
b = 12
h = (a > b)
print(h)


#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 12
b = 20
h = (a < b)
print(h)


#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 15
b = 12
h = (a >= b)
print(h)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 12
b = 16
h = (a <= b)
print(h)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
a = 12
b = 12
h = (a == b)
prnt(h)
